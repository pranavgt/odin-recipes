# odin-recipes
This repository contains the project for building a basic recipe website as part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course. The main purpose of this project is to practice and showcase my HTML knowledge.

The website consists of a main index page and several recipe pages, linked from the index. Each recipe page contains information about a specific recipe including an image of the dish, a brief description, a list of ingredients, and an ordered list of cooking steps.

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

1. HTML Basics: Utilization of HTML tags and structures such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.
2. Hyperlinking: Ability to create relative links in HTML to connect various pages of a website.
3. Git and GitHub: Proficiency in using Git for version control, including making regular commits and pushing to a GitHub repository.
4. GitHub Pages: Ability to host a static website using GitHub Pages and understand the importance of the index.html file.
